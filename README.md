This addon is in its earliest development stage and has not been released yet.

Despite this, feel free to contribute ;)

Upcoming features I'd like to include:
* Implement commands status, sync and scrub
* Scheduler for automatic sync and scrub

# kodi.snapraid
Provides basic commands for interaction between Kodi/XBMC and SnapRaid.

## Kodi
Kodi™ (formerly known as XBMC™) is an award-winning free and open source (GPL) software media center for playing videos, music, pictures, games, and more.
Kodi runs on Linux, OS X, Windows, iOS, and Android, featuring a 10-foot user interface for use with televisions and remote controls.
It allows users to play and view most videos, music, podcasts, and other digital media files from local and network storage media and the internet.

## Snapraid
SnapRAID is a backup program for disk arrays. It stores parity information of your data and it recovers from up to six disk failures.
SnapRAID is mainly targeted for a home media center, with a lot of big files that rarely change.
